# BinaryMerkleTree_MelloMM
Python3 implementation of a *binary* Merkle trees provided by MelloMM.

MelloMM set of repos targets the technicals of blockchain, especially Ethereum-based blockchains.

## Content
This repo shows a demo of a *binary* Merkle tree. These are simple, but they are not the trees used in Ethereum, which uses indeed [Merkle Patricia trees](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/11/15/merkling-in-ethereum/). This repo shows a demo of binary trees, whereas the MelloMM's demo of Patricia trees can be found [here (ToDo)]().

## Short theory
Merkle trees are wodely used to verify any kind of data which are transferred or archived through the use of cryptographic hashes. Briefly, "verifying" means assuring that a certain data block has not been tampered/it really comes from who claims to be the sender of it. Variants of Merkle trees are used in peer-to-peer networks such as Ethereum or Bitcoin.

Merkle tree composition:
*. Leaves are 
*. Non-leaves 

Any block of the blockchain is actually stored in a Merkle tree.
