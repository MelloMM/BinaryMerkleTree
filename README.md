# MerkleTree_MelloMM
Python3 implementation of a *binary* Merkle trees provided by MelloMM.

MelloMM set of repos targets the technicals of blockchain, especially Ethereum-based blockchains.

## Content
This repo shows a demo of a *binary* Merkle tree. These are simple, but they are not the trees used in Ethereum, which uses indeed [Merkle Patricia trees](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/11/15/merkling-in-ethereum/). This repo shows a demo of binary trees, whereas the MelloMM's demo of Patricia trees can be found [here (ToDo)]().
